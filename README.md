# ruby-exercice-Haolong
I have finished the basic functions of integration with Pipedriver,including add,delete,update,findbyname about contacts.
I also have written the rspec test code in this file
I will add Organizations.rb about integration of Organizations tomorrow casue I have to prepare for tomorrow's defense in EPITECH.
The update depends on the id of contact now.I will also add a new function which can find contact by its name later.
Thanks for your help
